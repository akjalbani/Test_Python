Web reconnaissance is the process of gathering information 
about a website or web server in order to understand its capabilities 
and vulnerabilities. 

Here are some common techniques that can be used for web recon:

DNS enumeration: This involves querying DNS servers to gather information about domain names, 
subdomains, and related records. Tools like dig and nslookup can be used for this purpose.

Whois lookup: This involves using the whois command or a web-based whois lookup service to 
gather information about the owner and registrar of a domain.

HTTP header analysis: This involves sending HTTP requests to a web server and analyzing the 
response headers to gather information about the server, its configuration, and the technologies 
it is using. Tools like curl and wget can be used for this purpose.

Directory and file enumeration: This involves attempting to access directories and files on a 
web server that are not publicly listed. This can be done manually or using tools like dirb and dirbuster.

Vulnerability scanning: This involves using tools like nmap and nessus to scan a web server 
for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
