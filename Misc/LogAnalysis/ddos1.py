'''
This code creates a raw socket that listens for TCP traffic on the network and stores the IP address
of each incoming connection in a dictionary. It then increments a count for each IP address in the dictionary. 
If the count for a particular IP address exceeds a certain threshold (in this case, 100), 
the code assumes that a DDoS attack is in progress and prints a message.

Keep in mind that this is just a simple example and may not be sufficient for detecting all types of DDoS attacks. 
There are many other factors that you may need to consider when implementing a DDoS detection system, 
such as the type of attack, the size of the attack, and the capabilities of your server.
